In this analysis, we try to analyze data about patient treatment in one hospital in Indonesia. Datasets was taken from DPhi.com. We analyze the effect of error measurement (haemoglobin, haematocrit, erythrocyte, leucocyte, thrombocyte) to the accuracy of classification of patient treatment and we try to predict patient treatment using several machine learning model (SVM, Gradient Boosting, KNN, AdaBoost) and get best accuracy score 74.4 % using SVM.
